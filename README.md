This is a semi-portfolio website. I list my education, skills, and past projects in the home page.
The main content of the website is decided by the html file. The various sections, heading, fonts, and component styles are decided by the style.css file.
Main.js is a javascript that creates a popup that asks to confirm if you want to leave the page when clicking on an external link.
Visualizations.html is another page of the website, navigated to and from with a section link, that displays a visualization of my weekly sleep hours. The visualization is made with <div id="sleep-chart"></div> that is a chart that is made and controlled by vis.js.
At the bottom of the page, is a svg art section, where I tried to make a red panda/ raccoon, but the end result looks more like a fox.

Coding was asssited with the Visual code studio assistant. 

There are two pages, Home and Visualizations, which both can be naviated to and from by the labeled links at the bottom of both pages.
